# Post-Generation Offers (STEP 6 detail)

After presenting a validated Health Cloud story, offer these optional next steps. Each one
depends on an MCP server or CLI being connected — check availability first with
the MCP tooling and only offer what is usable. If a server is present but needs
auth, mention that it can be authenticated first.

> **MCP tool names are fully qualified** as `server:tool` (e.g.,
> `code-review-graph:query_graph`). In this workspace the underlying server ID
> may be prefixed (e.g., `project-0-IBXQA-code-review-graph`); use the tooling to
> resolve the exact ID before calling.

## 6.1 QTA Test Bridge (`qta-core`)

If the `qta-core` MCP server is connected, offer to convert acceptance criteria
into QTA-compatible test prompts.

```
"This story has [N] acceptance criteria. Would you like me to generate
QTA browser automation test prompts from them?"
```

Mapping rules for AC -> QTA prompt:

| AC Section | QTA Prompt Section |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Given** (precondition) | Navigation steps + setup context |
| **When** (user action) | Click, type, select interaction steps |
| **Then** (expected result) | Assertion / verification checks |
| OmniScript / component name | Target URL / flow identifier |

Example output:

```
QTA Test Prompt: "Open the Health Cloud Patient Services app. Navigate to the
Patient Inquiry queue. Verify that only open cases assigned to the running user
are listed with case number, patient name, category, SLA remaining, and priority.
Confirm a case flagged as adverse-event shows the parallel Pharmacovigilance
intake link and is not editable by the Care Coordinator profile."
```

Generate one QTA prompt per acceptance criterion. Store in `qta_test_prompts.md`
alongside the story.

## 6.2 Diagram Generation

Offer a diagram of the story (and, for an epic breakdown, an end-to-end
dependency chain). Use whichever is available, in this order:

1. **`udd-whiteboard`** MCP — collaborative whiteboard diagram.
2. **`figma`** MCP — if the team maintains design/flow diagrams in Figma.
3. **`diagram-beautifier`** skill — to produce a polished diagram.
4. **Mermaid fallback** — embed a Mermaid diagram directly in the story markdown.

The diagram should show:
- The current user story as the highlighted node
- The previous story that feeds into it and the next story that depends on it
- The full epic chain across all generated stories (epic breakdown mode)
- Any shared systems/objects (Product Item, Territory, Data Cloud) connecting stories

---

## 6.3 GUS Work Item Creation (`gus_server`)

If the `gus_server` MCP is connected (or GUS CLI via `sf data` as a fallback),
offer to create a work item:

```
"The story is validated. Would you like me to create a GUS work item?"
```

Map story sections to GUS fields:
- Story -> `Description`
- Acceptance Criteria -> `Acceptance_Criteria__c`
- Priority -> `Priority`
- Persona -> Team assignment context

---

## 6.4 Salesforce Docs Verification (`salesforce-docs`)

If the Salesforce Docs MCP is connected (`salesforce-docs:salesforce_docs_search`
/ `salesforce-docs:salesforce_docs_fetch`), use it to verify any **standard**
Salesforce / Health Cloud object, field, feature, or API fact the story
relies on (Account/Person Account/Patient record type, Case, CarePlan, CareRequest, HealthcareProvider
Transaction, Action Launcher, Territory) and cite the returned source URL. This
is the **primary** verification path for standard Health Cloud facts in a PNM workspace
where the Health Cloud package may not be deployed. Custom `HC_*` components are still
verified via `code-review-graph`.

---

## 6.5 Knowledge Base (`notebooklm`)

If the `notebooklm` MCP is connected, use it to consult the shared **Salesforce
Health Cloud Librarian** notebook for Health Cloud best practices, data models, and
implementation patterns when a story touches unfamiliar commercial or medical
territory. This is also where the JIRA-generation reference guidance lives.

---

## 6.6 Story Dependency Check

After generating, scan `requirements/` for stories that reference the same
components. Report any dependencies or conflicts:

```
"I found 2 existing stories that reference the same components:
  - HC_PatientCallLogging_UserStory.md
  This story depends on the Product Item model from that story and blocks the
  reconciliation story. Would you like me to add cross-references?"
```

---

## 6.7 Product-Owner HTML Prototype (Salesforce-grounded)

After a validated story, offer to generate a **single-file, clickable HTML
prototype** that shows the product owner what the built feature will look and
behave like — **grounded in a Salesforce build-technology decision**, not a
generic web mockup.

```
"Would you like me to generate a clickable HTML prototype of this story?
It will label each screen with the Salesforce component that will build it
(OOTB Lightning record page + Dynamic Actions, Screen Flow, LWC,
OmniScript + FlexCard) so you can see whether we can ship this with OOTB
or need LWC/Flow work."
```

### Why this offering exists (Product Owner point of view)

Product Owners repeatedly ask two questions the acceptance criteria alone
cannot answer:

1. **"What will this actually look like on-screen?"** — they need a clickable
   walkthrough, not just Given/When/Then.
2. **"Can we build this with OOTB Lightning, or do we need LWC / Screen Flow /
   OmniStudio?"** — they need to know the *cost shape* of the story before
   sizing it.

A generic HTML mockup answers (1) and misleads on (2). A Salesforce-**grounded**
prototype answers both — every visible element is annotated with the platform
mechanism that will realize it, and the "Build Technology" header up front tells
the PO whether this is a **declarative** build, a **light-code** build, or a
**custom-code** build.

### Hard requirements (blockers)

A prototype produced by this skill MUST:

1. **State the Build Technology at the top** — using the primer's
   `.lsc-build-banner` (§8). The banner text is the same value that appeared
   in the story's `Build Technology` header field (RULE 7a), with a one-line
   rationale and the rejected alternative.
2. **Label every interactive element** with the Salesforce component that will
   implement it, using the primer's **`.lsc-badge`** vocabulary (§8):
   `OOTB` / `Config` / `Flow` / `LWC` / `OS` / `Apex` / `Ext`.
3. **Match the story's ACs** — every happy-path AC in the story must be
   reachable in the click-through; the edge-case AC(s) should be linked from a
   secondary state (error banner, empty state, offline state).
4. **Match the story's Pattern E field spec (RULE 15)** — forms that create or
   update records must show every field listed in the Pattern E table, using
   the same labels/values, with the record's target object annotated
   (e.g., "creates `Case` + `ContactEncounter` (Pattern E §1–§2)").
5. **Be a single self-contained `.html` file** — inline CSS + inline SVG icon
   sprite, no external fonts/JS/CDN dependencies. Portable so the PO can
   email it or open it from their desktop.
6. **Use SLDS 2 + Cosmos styling per `references/slds2-lsc-primer.md`.** Every
   prototype:
   - Opens with the primer's `:root { --slds-g-* … }` CSS variable block (§1).
   - Uses SLDS 2 utility classes (`slds-grid`, `slds-p-around_medium`,
     `slds-text-heading_small`, etc.) from the primer's §4.
   - Builds screens from the primer's blueprint recipes (§5): page header,
     path, tabs, card, form, data table, buttons, modal, alert, related list,
     empty state, action bar.
   - Uses the primer's Health Cloud icon vocabulary (§6) inline as an `<svg><symbol>`
     sprite.
   - Applies component styles from the primer's §7.
   - Applies the Health Cloud build-tech badge overlay from the primer's §8.
   - Passes the primer's §10 **10-point self-check** and records the score
     as an HTML comment at the top of the file (score-only rule — never
     block save, always record).

   **Do not** hand-invent SLDS class names. **Do not** ship generic
   Bootstrap/Material chrome. **Do not** import SLDS from a CDN — self-contained
   file only.
7. **Include a Build-Technology legend** — a footer or sidebar block that
   enumerates the components used, the effort size for each (S/M/L from the
   story's Estimated Effort table), and the OmniStudio runtime choice if
   OmniStudio is in scope.
8. **Never invent component or field names.** Reuse the exact names verified
   in STEP 3 (custom via `code-review-graph`, standard Health Cloud via
   `salesforce-docs`); mark unverified names as `(proposed)` — same rule as
   the story itself (RULE 3 / 3a).
9. **Never redefine or override the primer's hooks or utilities.** The primer
   is the single source of truth for SLDS 2 + Cosmos in this workspace; a
   prototype that redefines `--slds-g-*` values or overrides `.slds-*` classes
   is not compliant.

### Structure

A minimum Health Cloud prototype has:

| Region | Primer recipe | Salesforce grounding |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Global header strip** | §5.12 (`.slds-global-header`) | App name, running-user context |
| **Build-technology banner** | §8 (`.lsc-build-banner`) | Chosen tech + rationale + rejected alternative from the story |
| **Page header** | §5.1 (`.slds-page-header`) | The record page top — labelled `OOTB` when standard |
| **Path** (record process stages) | §5.2 (`.slds-path`) | Standard `OOTB · Path` |
| **Tabs** (record page sections) | §5.3 (`.slds-tabs_default`) | Standard `OOTB` tabs |
| **Main canvas** | Any combination of §5.4–§5.11 (card, form, table, buttons, modal, alerts, related list, empty state) | Each recipe labelled with its Salesforce component |
| **State toggler** (happy-path / edge-case / error / success) | Multi-file or in-page tabbed states | Mirrors the ACs |
| **Build-tech legend / footer** | Component inventory | Directly mirrors the story's Estimated Effort table |

### Screen-labelling conventions

Use the primer's `.lsc-badge` vocabulary (§8) on every interactive element:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `OOTB`   | Standard Salesforce, no config change |
| `Config` | Declarative — Dynamic Actions, Field Sets, Page Layout, custom field |
| `Flow`   | Screen Flow · Record-Triggered Flow · Subflow |
| `LWC`    | Lightning Web Component (custom code) |
| `OS`     | OmniScript step |
| `Apex`   | Apex trigger, invocable, controller |
| `Ext`    | External integration — MuleSoft · EHR (HL7 v2 / FHIR R4) · Data Cloud · telephony (Service Cloud Voice) |

Every badge carries a one-line caption explaining the "why" (e.g.
`<span class="lsc-badge flow">Flow · licence check</span>`).

### File placement

Save the prototype next to the story:

```
requirements/<StoryName>_Prototype.html
```

…and reference it from the story's `## Definition of done` section (add a
"Prototype reviewed with PO" checkbox).

### When NOT to use

- **Bug-fix stories** where the UI does not change — skip the prototype.
- **Pure backend / integration stories** (e.g. a MuleSoft eligibility 270/271 sync change) —
  a sequence diagram is a better artifact; offer 6.2 instead.
- **Stories that violate the AC-format or persona hard blockers** — fix the
  story before producing a prototype. A grounded prototype cannot rescue an
  ungrounded story.

### Handoff prompt template

When the user accepts this offer, produce the file, then say:

```
Prototype saved to requirements/<StoryName>_Prototype.html
Build technology: <e.g. OOTB Lightning record page + Dynamic Actions + one
Screen Flow>. Rejected alternative: <e.g. OmniScript — overkill for a
single-screen action>.

Open the file locally to click through the happy-path and edge-case states.
Every screen element is badged with the Salesforce component that will
implement it. Effort inventory is at the bottom of the file — it mirrors
the Estimated Effort table in the story.
```
